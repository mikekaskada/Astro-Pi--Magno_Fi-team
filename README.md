## Studying Earth's Magnetic Field through Astro Pi Data

This study includes data gathered from past missions of the Astro Pi, as well as data from the 2022-2023 mission.
## Initial Research Questions
1. How is Earth’s magnetic field from ISS? Is it different from ground measurements?
2. Is there a relationship of the strength of the magnetic field and longitude or latitude? What kind of relationship?
3. How fast does the strength or the direction of the field change over time or from position to position?
4. Are there any anomalies on Earth’s magnetic field?
